# What's the Dew Point?

According to the [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/arx/why_dewpoint_vs_humidity), the dew point is

> the temperature the air needs to be cooled to in order to achieve a relative humidity (RH) of 100%. The higher the dew point rises, the greater the amount of moisture in the air. This directly affects how "comfortable" it will feel outside. So if you want a real judge of just how "dry" or "humid" it will feel outside, look at the dew point instead of the RH. The higher the dew point, the muggier it will feel.

It's easy to only glance at the humidity value when they are trying to figure out if it's muggy or comfortable outside, but the dew point value is really the one to use for answering that question. With "What's the Dew Point?", you can quickly view color-coded current and forecasted dew point values to gauge how comfortable or uncomfortable it is outside today and what the week ahead looks like as well.
